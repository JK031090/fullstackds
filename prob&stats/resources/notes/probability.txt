## Permuatations

Permutations - arrangement of objects in a certain order.
Simple Permutation - n!
number of permutation by taking r objects at a time
    nPr = n!/(n-r)!

number of arrangements with repetition taking r objects at a time
    n^r

## Combinations

unordered arrangement of objects = combination
number of combinations of a set of n objects taken r at a time:
    nCr = n!/r!(n-r)!

number of combinations taken r at a time and allowing repetition:
    n+r-1Cr = (n+r-1)! / r!(n-1)!

## Conditional Probability

P(A|B) = P(A intersection B)/ P(B)
