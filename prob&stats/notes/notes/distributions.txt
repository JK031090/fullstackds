## Discrete probability distributions

## Uniform distributions

#Discrete - all discrete outcomes have same probability 
 eg. rolling a die each outcome is equally likely with P = 1/6

 # Binomial distributions
 there are 2 discrete mutually exclusive outcomes of a trial
 eg: head/tail , on/off, sick/healthy, success/failure

 Bernoulli trials; random experiment where ther are only two possible outcomes
 Series of n trials will follow a binomial distribution if
 1. probability of success (p) is constant
 2. trials are independent of each other.

Binomail probability mass function:

Probability of observing x success in n trials
P(x:n,p) = (nCx)(p)^x (1-p)^(n-x)

## Poisson distribution

considers number of successes per unit of time or any continuous unit

Poisson pmf
    E(X) = mu

lambda = # of occurences/interval = mu
P(x) = (lambda ^ x) * (e^-lambda) / x!
e = Euler's number = 2.718


### Continuous distributions - Normal/Expo/Beta
also called probability density functions

In discrete sum of values of individual bars = 1
whereas in continuous the area under curve = 1

Standard Normal Distro 
    mean = 0 , std = 1
    68.27% of values will fall under 1 std
    95.45% values under 2std
    99.73% values under 3 std
