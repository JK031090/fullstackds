Different types of categorical measurements
1. Nominal - pre-determined categories
            cannot be sorted
            e.g. Animal classification, political parites etc
2. Ordinal - can be sorted
            no scale
            survey responses
3. Interval - provides scale
                lacks a zero point
                e.g. temperature
4. Ratio - e.g. Age, weight, salary

Population - every memeber of a group
Sample - a subset of members that time and resources allow to measure.

##Measures of Central Tendency
Mean/Median/Mode

mean = calculated average
median = middle value
mode = most frequent value

Characteristics
mean is influenced by outliers

## Measures of dispersion
Range/Variance/Standard Deviation

range = max-min
variance = calculated as the sum of square distances from each point to mean
difference between sample variance and population variance = Bessel's correction (n-1)

standard deviation = square root of variance

## Bi variate data and covariance

scatter plots may uncover correlation

covariance = 1/N sigma(x - xmu)(y-ymu)
