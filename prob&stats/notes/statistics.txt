#what is statistics?
application of what we know to what we want to know.

#population vs sample
Parameter : population
Statistic : sample

#sampling techniques
avoid bias in sampling

#bias
1. selection bias 
    undercoverage bias
    self-selection bias
    healthy-user bias

2. survivorship 

#Sampling techniques
1. Random sampling - every member in the population has an equal chance of being selected
2. Stratified random sampling
    if there are sub-groups within population use techniques
    data is first divided into sub-groups and sampling is done within sub-groups

3. Clustering

## Central Limit Theorem
Large number of Sample means will be normally distributed around the population means
even if the population mean is not normally distributed.

#Hypothesis testing
application of statistics to real world questions
assumption - null Hypothesis

reject or fail to reject the null Hypothesis
At the start of experiment null hypothesis is assumed to be true

if data fails to support the null hypothesis, only then we can look to alternate hypothesis.

Null hypothesis is always opposite of what we want to test.
Null hypothesis should contain equality, alternate no equality.
If the probability of observing these results is very small (p-value)
then we reject the null hypothesis

0.05 = level of significance


TEST OF MEANS / TEST OF PROPORTIONS
For test of means, we look at Z score

If p-value is low, null must go - reject H0
If p-value is high, null must fly - fail to reject H0 

## Type 1 and type 2 errors

Type 1 - reject a null hypothesis when it must have been supported
Type 2 - fail to reject null when that should have been rejected.

Eg: H0: Not pregnant
H1: Are pregnant

Type 1 error - false positive - Tell a 'man' he is pregnant
Type 2 error - false negative - Tell a 'pregnant lady' she is not pregnant

Student's T distribution
in z scores we need to know population standard deviation,
in case we do not know pop std deviation, in those cases we
do t-test.

t-test also considers sample variance.

## One-sample t-test

t-statistic = (xbar - mu)/ s/sqrt(n)

##Independent 2 sample t-test

a. equal sample size, equal variance

2 - sample t-test

t-distro have fatter tails than normal z-distro
means more variance!

### ANOVA

F-distribution

3 or more samples are from same population?

 Between groups: how far group means stray from overall mean
 Within groups: how far individual values vary from group mean

 F = Between groups/Within groups

 ANOVA - one way anova 1 independent variable
 Two way anova - 2 independent variables

 Example:
 multiple rows per block - 2 way anova with replication

 With replication:

 ### Chi-square
 this test is used to determine the probability of an observed frequency of events
 given an expected frequency!
